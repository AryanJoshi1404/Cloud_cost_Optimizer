I want to build a cloud-based analytics dashboard for small retail businesses.
The platform will collect sales data from multiple stores and generate weekly
and monthly performance reports.

The frontend will be built using React, and the backend will use Node.js with
a REST API architecture. PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database for
transactional data, and object storage will be used to store report files and
exported CSVs. Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed analytics data.

The application will be hosted on AWS. EC2 instances will be used for backend
services, and an application load balancer will be placed in front of the API.
CloudWatch will be used for monitoring and logging. A CDN will be used to serve
static frontend assets.

Non-functional requirements include scalability to handle traffic spikes,
high availability, cost efficiency, and basic security best practices.

My monthly cloud budget is 5000 INR.
